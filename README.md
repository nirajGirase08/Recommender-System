# 🎬 Recommendation System

A recommendation engine that predicts movie ratings and suggests movies to users using both **Item-Based** and **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a personalized movie recommender by analyzing past user ratings. It implements two collaborative filtering approaches:

- **Item-Based Filtering:** Computes similarity between movies and recommends similar ones to users.
- **User-Based Filtering:** Finds users with similar preferences and recommends movies they liked.

The system predicts missing ratings for unrated movies by calculating weighted averages of ratings from similar users or similar items. It then recommends movies predicted to have high ratings that the user hasn't watched yet.

## 🛠️ Features

- Construct user-item rating matrices from raw data
- Compute similarity matrices using cosine similarity for items and users
- Predict ratings for unrated movies using similarity-weighted averages
- Generate recommendations based on thresholded predicted ratings
- Efficient implementation leveraging Pandas and NumPy for vectorized operations

## 📁 Dataset

The input data consists of user-movie ratings, where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and values represent user ratings. You can use your own dataset or publicly available ones like the MovieLens dataset.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

The system first computes a similarity matrix—either between items (movies) or between users—using cosine similarity. For each user and each unrated movie, it calculates a weighted average of ratings from similar users or items. This weighted sum is normalized by the sum of the similarity scores to generate a predicted rating. Movies with predicted ratings above a certain threshold are then recommended to the user.

---

## 🚀 Usage

To use this recommender system, prepare your user-item rating matrix and similarity matrices for users or items. Then, use the implemented prediction function to estimate missing ratings. Finally, generate personalized movie recommendations for target users based on these predictions.

---

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics

The accuracy of the predictions can be evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). You can tune parameters such as similarity thresholds and the number of nearest neighbors to optimize recommendation quality.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Experiment with alternative similarity metrics, like Pearson correlation
- Combine user-based and item-based filtering into a hybrid recommender
- Improve scalability for large-scale datasets
- Incorporate additional data such as movie metadata or temporal information to enhance recommendations
